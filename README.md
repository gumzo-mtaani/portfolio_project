SIMPLE MAZE!!!

Thank you for viewing this code, this is the read me file for the Simple Maze ALX Portfolio Project.

Move through the maze using the W, S, A, D keys and use either Esc or the window close button to exit.

This is a simple maze-based game that I hope will entertain you and inspire you to become a developer.

To install this game, simply run make on terminal.
